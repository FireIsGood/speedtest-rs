# Speedtest{-cli,-go}, but in rust, Speedtest-Rust

This is a learning exercise for me to learn:

* How some python stuff maps to Rust
* Rust
* HTTP Libraries in Rust
* XML Parsing in Rust
* Sockets in Rust
* Threads with Rust
* Some really, really dumb napkin distance calculations

If I get this done, this should be a runtime-free tool that can run against
speedtest.net.
